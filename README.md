# SammieDaSnake
Creating the old school game Snake

The starter code contains comments and enough code to set up the basic structure of the game. You'll want to fork this branch or clone it
onto your local machine first. You can do this via Github and Pycharm, or use Git on the command line to set up the project. 

Please try finishing the code yourself before looking at the solutions. 

If you do get stuck a few resources to help you out: 
- [Python Documentation](https://www.python.org/doc/)
- [Pygame Documentation](https://www.pygame.org/docs/)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- Google
  - particularly if you run your code and get an error, copy and paste the error into Google for more information and possible solutions

Good luck!

When you're done, save your game file as yourlastname_SammieDaSnake and use Git to push it to this repo. This is a great time to familiarize yourself with
Git and Github! Again, use Stack Overflow and Google to help yourself out with this part if you're unsure how to start or get stuck. If you are using Pycharm
to build this, it has a Git plug-in you can use to commit your changes and then push to a repo of your choice. Then you can do a pull request.
