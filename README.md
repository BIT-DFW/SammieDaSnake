# SammieDaSnake
Creating the old school game Snake

The starter code contains comments and enough code to set up the basic structure of the game. YOu'll want to fork this branch or clone it
onto your local machine first.

Please try finishing the code yourself before looking at the solutions. 

If you do get stuck a few resources to help you out: 
https://www.python.org/doc/
https://www.pygame.org/docs/
Stack Overflow
Google: particularly if you run your code and get an error, copy and paste the error into Google for more information and possible solutions

Good luck!

When you're done, save your game file as yourlastname_SammieDaSnake and push it to this repo. This is a great time to familiarize yourself with
Git and Github! Again, use Stack Overflow and Google to help yourself out with this part if you're unsure how to start or get stuck.
